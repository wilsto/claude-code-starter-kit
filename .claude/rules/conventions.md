# Language & Style Conventions

- **Language**: French for conversation, English for code and commits
- If a plan goes off track: stop and re-plan immediately, do not push forward
- Autonomous bug fixing: diagnose and fix without asking for step-by-step guidance
- Prefer clean solutions over workarounds ("le plus simple et stable et pérenne")
- Never close/validate a ticket or GitHub issue without explicit user approval
